This directory contains the source to pdx, a Pascal debugger that
works with pi and px.  Pascal-dependent stuff is primarily in the
"sym" directory, p-code dependent stuff in "machine", and
object file format in "object".

The make file ("Makefile") is the best source of up-to-date general
comments about the pdx source.
