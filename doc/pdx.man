     ppddxx [--rr] [_o_b_j_f_i_l_e]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     PPddxx is a tool for source level debugging and execution of Pascal
     programs.  The _o_b_j_f_i_l_e is an object file produced by the Pascal
     translator pi(1).  If no _o_b_j_f_i_l_e is specified, ppddxx looks for a file named
     ``obj'' in the current directory.  The object file contains a symbol
     table which includes the name of the all the source files translated by
     pi(1) to create it.  These files are available for perusal while using
     the debugger.

     If the file "_._p_d_x_i_n_i_t" exists in the current directory, then the debugger
     commands in it are executed.

     --rr    The --rr option causes the _o_b_j_f_i_l_e to be executed immediately; if it
           terminates successfully ppddxx exits.  Otherwise it reports the reason
           for termination and offers the user the option of entering the
           debugger or simply letting px continue with a traceback.  If --rr is
           not specified, ppddxx just prompts and waits for a command.

     The commands are:

     rruunn [_a_r_g_s] [<< _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e] [>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
           Start executing _o_b_j_f_i_l_e, passing _a_r_g_s as command line arguments; <<
           or >> can be used to redirect input or output in the usual manner.

           Have tracing information printed when the program is executed.  A
           number is associated with the command that is used to turn the
           tracing off (see the ddeelleettee command).

           The first argument describes what is to be traced.  If it is a
           _s_o_u_r_c_e_-_l_i_n_e_-_n_u_m_b_e_r, then the line is printed immediately prior to
           being executed.  Source line numbers in a file other than the
           current one must be preceded by the name of the file and a colon,
           e.g.  ``mumble.p:17''.

           If the argument is a procedure or function name then every time it
           is called, information is printed telling what routine called it,
           from what source line it was called, and what parameters were
           passed to it.  In addition, its return is noted, and if it's a
           function then the value it is returning is also printed.

           If the argument is an _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n with an aatt clause then the value
           of the expression is printed whenever the identified source line is
           reached.

           If the argument is a variable then the name and value of the
           variable is printed whenever it changes.  Execution is
           substantially slower during this form of tracing.

           If no argument is specified then all source lines are printed
           before they are executed.  Execution is substantially slower during
           this form of tracing.

           The clause "iinn _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e_/_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n" restricts tracing information to
           be printed only while executing inside the given procedure or
           function.

           _C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n is a Pascal boolean expression and is evaluated prior to
           printing the tracing information; if it is false then the
           information is not printed.

           There is no restriction on the amount of information that can be
           traced.

           Stop execution when the given line is reached, procedure or
           function called, variable changed, or condition true.

     ddeelleettee _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_n_u_m_b_e_r
           The trace or stop corresponding to the given number is removed.
           The numbers associated with traces and stops are printed by the
           ssttaattuuss command.

     ssttaattuuss [>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
           Print out the currently active ttrraaccee and ssttoopp commands.

     ccoonntt  Continue execution from where it stopped.  This can only be done
           when the program was stopped by an interrupt or through use of the
           ssttoopp command.

     sstteepp  Execute one source line.

     nneexxtt  Execute up to the next source line.  The difference between this
           and sstteepp is that if the line contains a call to a procedure or
           function the sstteepp command will stop at the beginning of that block,
           while the nneexxtt command will not.

           Print out the values of the Pascal expressions.  Variables declared
           in an outer block but having the same identifier as one in the
           current block may be referenced as "_b_l_o_c_k_-_n_a_m_e _. _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e"

     wwhhaattiiss _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r
           Print the declaration of the given identifier.

     wwhhiicchh _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r
           Print the full qualification of the given identifer, i.e.  the
           outer blocks that the identifier is associated with.

     aassssiiggnn _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
           Assign the value of the expression to the variable.

     ccaallll _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e(parameters)
           Execute the object code associated with the named procedure or
           function.

     hheellpp  Print out a synopsis of ppddxx commands.

     ggrriippee
           Invokes a mail program to send a message to the person in charge of
           ppddxx.

     wwhheerree
           Print out a list of the active procedures and functions and the
           respective source line where they are called.

     ssoouurrccee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           Read ppddxx commands from the given _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  Especially useful when
           the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e has been created by redirecting a ssttaattuuss command from
           an earlier debugging session.

     dduummpp [>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
           Print the names and values of all active data.

           List the lines in the current source file from the first line
           number to the second inclusive.  As in the editor ``$'' can be used
           to refer to the last line.  If no lines are specified, the entire
           file is listed.  If the name of a procedure or function is given
           lines _n_-_k to _n_+_k are listed where _n is the first statement in the
           procedure or function and _k is small.

     ffiillee [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
           Change the current source file name to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  If none is
           specified then the current source file name is printed.

     eeddiitt [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
     eeddiitt _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e/_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e
           Invoke an editor on _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e or the current source file if none is
           specified.  If a _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e or _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n name is specified, the
           editor is invoked on the file that contains it.  Which editor is
           invoked by default depends on the installation.  The default can be
           overridden by setting the environment variable EDITOR to the name
           of the desired editor.

     ppii    Recompile the program and read in the new symbol table information.

     sshh _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_l_i_n_e
           Pass the command line to the shell for execution.  The SHELL
           environment variable determines which shell is used.

     aalliiaass _n_e_w_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_n_a_m_e _o_l_d_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_n_a_m_e
           This command makes ppddxx respond to _n_e_w_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_n_a_m_e the way it used
           to respond to _o_l_d_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_n_a_m_e.

     qquuiitt  Exit ppddxx.

     The following commands deal with the program at the _p_x instruction level
     rather than source level.  They are not intended for general use.

          Turn on tracing or set a stop using a ppxx machine instruction
          addresses.

     xxii _a_d_d_r_e_s_s [,, _a_d_d_r_e_s_s]
          Print the instructions starting at the first _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.  Instructions
          up to the second _a_d_d_r_e_s_s are printed.

     xxdd _a_d_d_r_e_s_s [,, _a_d_d_r_e_s_s]
          Print in octal the specified data location(s).

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     EDITOR
          The eeddiitt function uses the EDITOR environment variable to see what
          editor to use.

     SHELL
          The function sshh checks the SHELL variable to see which shell to
          execute.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     PPddxx appeared in 4.2BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     PPddxx does not understand sets, and provides no information about files.

     The wwhhaattiiss command doesn't quite work for variant records.

     Bad things will happen if a procedure invoked with the ccaallll command does
     a non-local goto.

     The commands sstteepp and nneexxtt should be able to take a _c_o_u_n_t that specifies
     how many lines to execute.

     There should be commands sstteeppii and nneexxttii that correspond to sstteepp and nneexxtt
     but work at the instruction level.

     There should be a way to get an address associated with a line number,
     procedure or function, and variable.

     Most of the command names are too long.

     The alias facility is quite weak.

     A csh(1)-like history capability would improve the situation.
