     PPmmeerrggee assembles the named Pascal files into a single standard Pascal
     program.  The resulting program is listed on the standard output.  It is
     intended to be used to merge a collection of separately compiled modules
     so that they can be run through ppii, or exported to other sites.

     The ppmmeerrggee command appeared in 4.1BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     Very minimal error checking is done, so incorrect programs will produce
     unpredictable results.  Block comments should be placed after the keyword
     to which they refer or they are likely to end up in bizarre places.
