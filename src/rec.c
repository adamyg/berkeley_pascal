/*
 * Build a record namelist entry.
 * Some of the processing here is somewhat involved.
 * The basic structure we are building is as follows.
 *
 * Each record has a main RECORD entry,
 * with an attached chain of fields as ->chain;
 * these enclude all the fields in all the variants of this record.
 * Fields are cons'ed to the front of the ->chain list as they are discovered.
 * This is for reclook(), but not for sizing and aligning offsets.
 *
 * If there are variants to the record, NL_TAG points to the field which
 * is the tag.  If its name is NIL, the tag field is unnamed, and is not
 * allocated any space in the record.
 * Attached to NL_VARNT is a chain of VARNT structures
 * describing each of the variants.  These are further linked
 * through ->chain.  Each VARNT has, in ->range[0] the value of
 * the associated constant, and each points at a RECORD describing
 * the subrecord through NL_VTOREC.  These pointers are not unique,
 * more than one VARNT may reference the same RECORD.
 *
 * On the first pass, we traverse the parse tree and construct the namelist
 * entries.  This pass fills in the alignment of each record (including
 * subrecords (the alignment of a record is the maximum of the alignments
 * of any of its fields).
 * A second pass over the namelist entries fills in the offsets of each field
 * based on the alignments required.  This second pass uses the NL_FIELDLIST
 * chaining of fields, and the NL_TAG pointer and the NL_VARNT pointer to get
 * to fields in the order in which they were declared.
 * This second pass can not be folded into the first pass,
 * as the starting offset of all variants is the same,
 * so we must see all the variants (and especially must know their alignments)
 * before assigning offsets.  With the alignments calculated (by the first
 * pass) this can be done in one top down pass, max'ing over the alignment of
 * variants before assigning offsets to any of them.
