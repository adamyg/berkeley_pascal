.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Pix
is a `load and go' version of Pascal which combines
the functions of the interpreter code translator
.Nm pi
and the executor
.Nm px  .
It uses
.Nm pi
to translate the program in the file
.Pa name.p
and, if there were no fatal errors during translation,
causes the resulting interpreter code
to be executed by
.Nm px
with the specified arguments.
A temporary file is used for the object code;
the file
.Pa obj
is neither created nor destroyed.
