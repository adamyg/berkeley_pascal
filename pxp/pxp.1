.Sh NAME
.Nm pxp
.Nd Pascal execution profiler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pxp
.Op Fl acdefjnstuw_
.Op Fl 23456789
.Op Fl z Op Ar name ...
.Ar name.p
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Pxp
can be used to obtain execution profiles of Pascal programs or
as a pretty-printer.
To produce an execution profile all that is necessary is to translate
the program specifying the
.Fl z
option to
.Xr pi 1
or
.Xr pix 1 ,
to execute the program,
and to then issue the command
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pxp -x name.p
.Ed
.Pp
A reformatted listing is output if none of the
.Fl c  ,
.Fl t ,
or
.Fl z
options are specified;
thus
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pxp old.p > new.p
.Ed
.Pp
places a pretty-printed version of the program in `old.p' in the file `new.p'.
.Pp
The use of the following options of
.Nm pxp
is discussed in sections 2.6, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.10 of the
.%T "Berkeley Pascal User's Manual" .
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
Print the bodies of all procedures and functions in the profile;
even those which were never executed.
.It Fl c
Extract profile data from the file
.Pa core  .
.It Fl d
Include declaration parts in a profile.
.It Fl e
Eliminate
.Ic include
directives when reformatting a file;
the
.Ic include
is replaced by the reformatted contents of the specified
file.
.It Fl f
Fully parenthesize expressions.
.It Fl j
Left justify all procedures and functions.
.It Fl n
Eject a new page
as each file is included;
in profiles, print a blank line at the top of the page.
.It Fl s
Strip comments from the input text.
.It Fl t
Print a table summarizing
.Ic procedure
and
.Ic function
call counts.
.It Fl u
Card image mode; only the first 72 characters of input lines
are used.
.It Fl w
Suppress warning diagnostics.
.It Fl z
Generate an execution profile.
If no
.Ar name Ns 's
are given the profile is of the entire program.
If a list of names is given, then only any specified
.Ic procedure Ns s
or
.Cx Ic function Ns s
and the contents of any specified
.Ic include
files will appear in the profile.
.It Fl \&_
Underline keywords.
.It Fl d
With
.Ar d
a digit, 2 \*(Le
.Ar d
\*(Le 9,
causes
.Nm pxp
to use
.Ar d
spaces as the basic indenting unit.
The default is 4.

For a basic explanation do

.Pp
Error diagnostics include
`No profile data in file'
with the
.Fl c
option if the
.Fl z
option was not enabled to
.Nm pi ;
`Not a Pascal system core file'
if the core is not from a
.Nm px
execution;
`Program and count data do not correspond'
if the program was changed after compilation, before profiling;
or if the wrong program is specified.
