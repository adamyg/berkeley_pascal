/*
 * COMMENT PROCESSING CLUSTER
 *
 * The global organization of this cluster is as follows.
 * While parsing the program information is saved in the tree which
 * tells the source text coordinates (sequence numbers and columns)
 * bounding each production.  The comments from the source program
 * are also saved, with information about their source text position
 * and a classification as to their kind.
 *
 * When printing the reformatted program we flush out the comments
 * at various points using the information in the comments and the parse
 * tree to "resynchronize".  A number of special cases are recognized to
 * deal with the vagarities of producing a true "fixed point" so that
 * a prettyprinted program will re-prettyprint to itself.
 */

/*
 * Save sequence id's and column markers bounding a production
 * for later use in placing comments.  We save the sequence id
 * and column of the leftmost token and the following token, and
 * the sequence id of the last token in this reduction.
 * See putcm, putcml, and putcmp below for motivation.
