 * Option flags
 *
 * The following options are recognized on the command line by pxp.
 * Only the u, w, and z options here have effect in comments in the
 * program; the others are command line only, and unrelated
 * to the options with the same designations in comments.
 *
 *	a	Print all routines in a profile; normally, routines
 *		which have never been executed have their bodies suppressed.
 *
 *	c	Extract profile data from the file core, or the file
 *		named after the last argument rather than the file 'pmon.out'.
 *		Must be used with z to have an effect.
 *
 *	d	Suppress declarations
 *
 *	f	Fully parenthesize expressions.
 *
 *	j	Left justify all procedures and functions rather than
 *		indenting them.
 *
 *	n	Eject a new page in the listing as each 'include' file
 *		is incorporated into the profile.
 *
 *	o	Put output prettyprint in first argument file
 *
 *	p	Pretty print a main program without processing
 *		the include statements.
 *
 *	t	Print a table summarizing procedure and function call counts.
 *
 *	u	Card image mode; only the first 72 chars on a line count.
 *
 *	w	Suppress certain warning diagnostics.
 *
 *	z	Generate an execution profile of the program.
 *		May also be followed by a list of procedure and function
 *		names mixed, if desired, with include file names.
 *		Only these procedures and functions, and the contents
 *		of the specified include files will then be profiled.
 *
 *  [23456789]	Use the specified number of spaces for the basic
 *		indenting unit in the program.
 *
 *	_	Underline keywords in the output.
 *
 *	O	remove `others'.  if an `others' label is found in a
 *		case statement the case statement (minus the others case)
 *		is printed as a guarded case statement, and the others case
 *		is the else branch of the guard.  this transformation
 *		causes the case selector to be evaluated twice, a lose
 *		if the selector has side-effects.  this option is only
 *		available if pxp is compiled with RMOTHERS defined.

 * The flag nojunk means that header lines
