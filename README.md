# Berkeley Pascal

Berkeley Pascal was developed within the Computer Science Division; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science;
University of California, Berkeley by William N. Joy, Susan L. Graham and Charles B. Haley. It was originally designed for interactive instructional use on the PDP/11 and VAX/11 computers. Interpretive P-code is produced, providing fast translation at the expense of slower execution speed. 

This project is an investigation into retargeting to modern hosts, with the intention of exploring use within embedded systems/applications.
