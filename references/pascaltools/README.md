### Software Tools in Pascal

	Copyright (C) 1981 by Bell Laboratories, Inc., and Whitesmiths Ltd.

	This tape or disk contains all of the programs from
	Software Tools in Pascal, plus the documentation.
	There are 361 files (8500 lines; 210000 characters).
	The format of the tape is 800 bpi 9 track ASCII in 512 byte blocks.
	Each source line is terminated by an ASCII newline character;
	each file is introduced by a line of the form

	-h- directory/filename number-of-bytes

	as in the archive program of Chapter 3.
	The "number-of-bytes" field includes the copyright notice
	and the terminating newline.
	The "directory" is intended to help you assign the
	files to the proper programs.  Directories are:

	UCBPRIMS	primitives for UCB Pascal
	WSPRIMS		primitives for Whitesmiths Pascal
	UCSDPRIMS	primitives for UCSD Pascal
	UTIL		utility routines common to all programs

	INTRO		programs from Chapter 1
	FILTERS		all programs from Chapter 2 except translit
	TRANSLIT	translit program from Chapter 2
	FILEIO		early programs in Chapter 3
	PRINT		print programs from Chapter 3
	ARCHIVE		archive program from Chapter 3
	SORT		all programs from Chapter 4; mostly sorting
	EDIT		all programs from Chapters 5 and 6: find, change, edit
	FORMAT		format program from Chapter 7
	MACRO		define and macro processors from Chapter 8

	MAN		manual pages for programs
	PMAN		manual pages for primitives

	Within each group, files are presented in alphabetical order.
	Each file begins with a header like this one:
