To translate a program using pc, place the source in a file whose name ends
in the characters ".p", e.g. "prog.p".  The command
	pc prog.p
will translate the program, leaving an executable program in the file a.out
in the current directory.  This code can be executed by typing
	a.out
The complete command line syntax for pc is
	pc [ option ] [ -i file ... ] name.p ...
The command "man pc" will give information as to the options of pc.
